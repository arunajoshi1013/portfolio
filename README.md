# Epicodus HTML and CSS project
This project is my beginner project that showcases the HTML and CSS basics that
I've learned in the Introduction to Programming part-time course at Epicodus, Portland.
In this project I've created a very simple web page that will be hosted on Github pages
and describes a little bit about me and links to other demo projects that I've
done so far in this introductory class.
It consists of a index.html file and a .css file along with a .jpg file that is
sourced into the web page.
